# A 15-Year Analysis of Food Price Inflation (2008 - 2026)
# 📌 Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of food price volatility and economic trends in Myanmar over a 15-year period. Utilizing official World Food Programme (WFP) data, I tracked the cost of essential commodities to identify patterns of inflation and regional price disparities during periods of significant socioeconomic change.
# 🛠️ Tech Stack
 * Data Cleaning: Python (Pandas) / Power Query
 * Analysis: SQL (Window Functions, Aggregations)
 * Visualization: Power BI & Matplotlib/Seaborn
 * Data Source: Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) - WFP Myanmar
# 📊 Key Insights
 * Extreme Inflation: Identified a significant structural break in price stability starting in 2022, with staple goods like Rice and Palm Oil seeing triple-digit percentage increases in local currency (MMK).
 * Regional Anomalies: Through SQL analysis, I discovered that Chin State and Rakhine State consistently record the highest prices for vegetables and oils, likely due to supply chain disruptions.
 * Record Highs: The most expensive food item recorded was Onions (local) in March 2025, reaching 45,000 MMK per KG in remote markets.
# 📂 Project Structure
 * /data: Contains the raw and cleaned CSV files.
 * /scripts: Python code used for cleaning and automated visualization.
 * /visuals: Exported PNG charts and a PDF export of the Power BI dashboard.
 * queries.sql: SQL scripts used to extract "Most Expensive" and "Regional Average" metrics.
# 🚀 Business Recommendation
Based on the trend analysis, food security interventions should prioritize border regions where transport costs drive local prices 3-4x higher than the national average. Stabilizing the cost of low-quality rice should be the primary focus for regional economic policy.
